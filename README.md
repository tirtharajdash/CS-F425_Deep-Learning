## Scope and Objective of the course

Neural Networks has had a long and rich history, and the reincarnated
viewpoint has shifted towards "Deep Neural Networks\" or "Deep
Learning\", primarily due to, (a) availability of the large amount of
data, (b) extensive use of powerful graphics processors, (c)
availability of software libraries to facilitate deep network
implementations, and (d) significant involvement of industrial research
labs in deep learning research.

This course on "Deep Learning" would focus on the conceptual and
mathematical foundation and computational investigations of recent deep
models as part of a series of laboratory experiments and projects. For
instance, we will focus on newer convolutional neural networks such as
VGG Net, ResNet; various sequence models including attention-based
models such as transformers; and also we will touch upon graph
representation learning using graph neural networks.

At the end of this course, students should be able to (0) pose
real-world problems in deep learning, (1) source and prepare datasets,
(2) design suitable deep network architecture, (3) prepare input-output
representation (and encodings), (4) decide and design a suitable loss
function for training a deep network, (5) training and deploying deep
models.
